## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the Mentora AI project for local development.

### Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Version 3.10+
*   **Node.js:** Version 18.x or later (Check `frontend/debug_frontend/package.json` engines field if specified)
*   **npm:** Version 8.x or later (Usually comes with Node.js)
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
*   **(Optional) Docker:** If you plan to use Docker for running the backend.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd mentora-project # Or your project's root directory name
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
    Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Optional) Set up your `.env` file. If an `.env.example` is present, copy it to `.env` and fill in the necessary values.
    Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```
    The backend should now be running (typically on a port like 8000 or 5000).

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend/debug_frontend # Assuming you are in the backend directory
    # Or from root: cd frontend/debug_frontend
    ```
    Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Run the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend development server will start, typically on a port like `5173` (Vite default). Open your browser to the specified address.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into main directories:

*   `backend/`: Contains all the Python (FastAPI) server-side code, API logic, database interactions, and Docker configurations.
*   `frontend/debug_frontend/`: Contains the client-side React application code, built with Vite.
*   The existing README also mentioned a `server/` directory for "Zusätzliche Server-Komponenten und Agenten". You may want to detail its contents here if it's a key part of the project.

## 🐳 Docker (Optional Backend)

The backend can also be run using Docker. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

From the `backend/` directory:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will build the Docker image (if not already built) and start the backend service as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
