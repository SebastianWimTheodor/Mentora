# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Mentora is an AI-powered educational platform designed to create personalized learning experiences for students and lifelong learners. The platform takes user queries about learning topics, accepts file uploads (such as university scripts or slides), and uses AI agents to automatically generate structured courses with interactive visualizations and assessments. The system adapts to user preferences including available time and desired difficulty level.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to input what I want to learn about and upload relevant materials, so that I can get a personalized learning experience based on my existing resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL display a query input field asking "What do you want to learn about?"
2. WHEN a user enters a learning topic THEN the system SHALL accept and store the query
3. WHEN a user wants to upload files THEN the system SHALL provide a file upload interface that accepts common document formats (PDF, DOCX, PPT, TXT)
4. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sizes (max 50MB per file)
5. WHEN invalid files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to specify my learning preferences including time availability and difficulty level, so that the course can be tailored to my constraints and capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has entered their learning topic THEN the system SHALL present a preferences form
2. WHEN setting time preferences THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify available time (hours per day/week)
3. WHEN setting difficulty THEN the system SHALL provide difficulty options (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
4. WHEN preferences are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate and store all preference data
5. IF required preferences are missing THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to complete them

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a learner, I want an AI planner to automatically create a structured course outline, so that I have a clear learning path with organized chapters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user preferences are submitted THEN the planner agent SHALL analyze the learning topic and uploaded materials
2. WHEN planning is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a course outline with numbered chapters
3. WHEN creating chapters THEN each chapter SHALL have a title and learning objectives
4. WHEN determining chapter count THEN the system SHALL consider user's available time and difficulty preferences
5. WHEN the outline is ready THEN the system SHALL display it to the user for review

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a learner, I want interactive visualizations for each chapter, so that I can understand complex concepts through engaging visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chapter is selected THEN the explainer agent SHALL generate interactive content for that chapter
2. WHEN creating visualizations THEN the system SHALL include diagrams, charts, or interactive elements appropriate to the topic
3. WHEN content is generated THEN it SHALL be presented in a user-friendly, interactive format
4. WHEN visualizations are displayed THEN users SHALL be able to interact with elements (zoom, click, hover for details)
5. WHEN content is complex THEN the system SHALL break it into digestible sections with clear explanations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a learner, I want multiple choice quizzes for each chapter, so that I can test my understanding and reinforce my learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chapter's content is complete THEN the quiz agent SHALL generate multiple choice questions
2. WHEN creating quizzes THEN each question SHALL have 4 answer options with one correct answer
3. WHEN questions are generated THEN they SHALL test key concepts from the chapter content
4. WHEN a user takes a quiz THEN the system SHALL track their answers and provide immediate feedback
5. WHEN quiz is completed THEN the system SHALL display the score and explanations for incorrect answers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to progress through the course at my own pace, so that I can learn effectively according to my schedule and comprehension speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the course is ready THEN the system SHALL present chapters in a sequential learning interface
2. WHEN a user completes a chapter THEN they SHALL be able to proceed to the next chapter
3. WHEN learning is in progress THEN the system SHALL save user progress automatically
4. WHEN a user returns to the platform THEN they SHALL be able to resume from where they left off
5. WHEN a user wants to review THEN they SHALL be able to access previously completed chapters

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide helpful feedback, so that I can continue learning even when technical issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file processing fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and suggested solutions
2. WHEN AI agents encounter errors THEN the system SHALL retry operations and notify users of delays
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL cache progress locally and sync when connection is restored
4. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL guide users to correct the input
5. WHEN system is overloaded THEN users SHALL be informed of wait times and given options to continue later
