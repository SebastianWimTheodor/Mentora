## Latex

You can use Latex in your code with the <Latex> tag.

return (
    <Latex>{"We give illustrations for the processes $e^+e^-$, gluon-gluon and $\\gamma\\gamma \\to W t\\bar b$."}</Latex>
    <Latex>{"$2^3$"}</Latex>
);

Please use $ as a delimiter for every math expressions inside the <Latex> tag as you see in the example.
Wrap all the content you write in the <Latex> tags with a {""}
Inside the {""} please do not use another " as it will close the first " and therefore lead to parsing issues
