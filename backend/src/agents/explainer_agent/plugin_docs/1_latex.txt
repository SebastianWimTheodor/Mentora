## Latex

You can use Latex in your code with the <Latex> tag.
In the following you will see an example where I substituted curly braces with % due to formatting issues. You should use
curly braces though.

return (
    <Latex>%'We give illustrations for the %1 + 2% processes $e^+e^-$, gluon-gluon and $\\gamma\\gamma \\to W t\\bar b$.'%</Latex>
);

Please use $ as a delimiter for every math expressions inside the <Latex> tag as you see in the example.
Remember that all % in the above example should be replaced with curly braces.
Wrap all the content you write in the <Latex> tags with a %''%, % again standing for curly braces.
