## Latex

You can use Latex in your code with the <Latex> tag.
In the following you will see an example where I substituted curly braces with % due to formatting issues. You should use
curly braces though.

() => {
  return (
    <Latex>We give illustrations for the %1 + 2% processes $e^+e^-$, gluon-gluon and $\\gamma\\gamma \\to W t\\bar b$.</Latex>
  );
}
